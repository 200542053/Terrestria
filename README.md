# Terrestria

Terrestria is an upcoming biomes mod for Fabric targeting Minecraft 1.14.2 and above, inspired by ExtrabiomesXL for
1.4.7 and 1.7.10 as well as certain aspects of RedPower World from 1.4.7.

It features the following 29 biomes currently, 12 of which are primary biomes and 17 of which are sub biomes:

 * Caldera (multipart biome): A high altitude body of water - colored with a distinct aqua green color - surrounded by 
   towering mountains
   * Caldera Beach: Acts as a transition between the Ridge and the center of the Caldera. Both the Caldera Beach
     and the Caldera biome contribute to beach formation, as beaches are generated in the same way as in Beta
     1.7.3: based on height, not simply on biome.
   * Caldera Ridge: This surrounds the inner body of water and ensures that it is not exposed to the exterior world.
   * Caldera Foothills: Surrounding the Caldera Ridge, this biome serves to smooth the transition between the towering
     ridges and flatter surroundings.
   
 * Cypress Forest: A forest filled with Cypress and Birch trees.
   * Wooded Cypress Hills: A more mountainous variant of the Cypress Forest.
   
 * Cypress Swamp: A distinctly green swamp biome filled with huge canopy Cypress trees, willow trees, cattails, and
   green water.
   
 * Dense Woodlands: A cross between a Plains biome and a Forest, this forest is distinct for containing only large Oak
   trees in an environment with large amounts of Plains grass.
   * Dense Woodlands Edge: Separates the Dense Woodlands from the surrounding barren terrain.
   
 * Hemlock Rainforest: A high altitude forest filled with Hemlock trees, ranging from massive 2x2 trees to still massive
   1x1 trees to tiny spruce like trees, littered with ferns and fallen logs.
   * Hemlock Clearing: A zone with far less trees, providing a natural clearing from the extremely dense canopy.
   
 * Japanese Maple Forest: Similar to the Sakura Forest, but with Japanese Maple Trees and a less tropical climate.
    Japanese Maple trees have a similar shape to Sakura Trees, but have full block logs instead of small ones.
    * Wooded Cypress Hills: A more mountainous variant of the Japanese Maple Forest.
    
 * Lush Redwood Forest: A similar biome to the Hemlock Rainforest, but instead of mega Hemlock trees, it has mega Redwood
   trees and tiny redwood trees as well as a far greener grass color.
   * Lush Redwood Clearing: A clearing within the forest, providing a natural place to build a base.
   * Lush Redwood Forest Edge: A less dense area providing a separation from other biomes.

 * Rainbow Rainforest: A Jungle derivative filled with Rainbow Eucalyptus trees, and far more mountainous.
   * Rainbow Rainforest Mountains: An even more mountainous variant of the former.
   * Rainbow Rainforest Lake: A low and flat area within the forest usually filled with pools of water.

 * Redwood Forest: A less lush variant of the Lush Redwood Forest
   * Redwood Clearing: A clearing within the forest, providing a natural place to build a base.
   * Redwood Forest Edge: A less dense area providing a separation from other biomes.

 * Sakura Forest: Also known as the Cherry Blossom Forest, this is a forest filled with Sakura Trees as well as Japanese Maple Shrubs.
   With the distinctive miniature Sakura logs as well as piles of Sakura leaves, this marks a rather unique forest biome.
   * Wooded Cypress Hills: A more mountainous variant of the Sakura Forest.

 * Snowy Hemlock Forest: A snowy variant of the Hemlock Rainforest
   * Snowy Hemlock Clearing: A snowy variant of the Hemlock Clearing

 * Volcanic Island: A very lush island filled with basalt cliffs, beaches, and volcanoes.
   * Volcanic Island Beach: A smaller beach area surrounding the shore and main island area.
   * Volcanic Island Shore: A large flat beach surrounding the central island, with a mix of basalt and normal sand.
