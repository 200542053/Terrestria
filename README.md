# Terrestria

Terrestria is an upcoming biomes mod for Fabric targeting Minecraft 1.14.2 and above, inspired by ExtrabiomesXL for
1.4.7 and 1.7.10 as well as certain aspects of RedPower World from 1.4.7.

It features the following 8 biomes currently:

 * Cypress Forest: A forest filled with Cypress Trees instead of Oak Trees.
 * Sakura Forest: Also known as the Cherry Blossom Forest, this is a forest filled with Sakura Trees as well as Japanese Maple Shrubs.
   With the distinctive miniature Sakura logs as well as piles of Sakura leaves, this marks a rather unique biome.
 * Japanese Maple Forest: Similar to the Sakura Forest, but with Japanese Maple Trees and a less tropical climate.
   Japanese Maple trees have a similar shape to Sakura Trees, but have full block logs instead of small ones.
 * Cypress Swamp: A distinctly green swamp biome filled with plant life, including the magestic Bald Cypress tree.
 * Rainforest: A Jungle derivative filled with Rainbow Eucalyptus trees.
 * Caldera (multipart biome): A high altitude body of water - colored with a distinct aqua green color - surrounded by 
   towering mountains, and made up of 3 component biomes:
   * Caldera Ridge: This surrounds the inner body of water and ensures that it is not exposed to the exterior world.
   * Caldera Beach: Acts as a transition between the Ridge and the center of the Caldera. Both the Caldera Beach
     and the Caldera biome contribute to beach formation, as beaches are generated in the same way as in Beta
     1.7.3: based on height, not simply on biome.
   * Caldera: The main body of water, allowing bodies of water to exist at y=100.
