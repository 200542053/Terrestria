## About Terrestria

Terrestria aims to be the next up-and-coming biomes mod for target versions of minecraft 1.14.x and above.
We took great inspiration from the ExtrabiomesXL mod released for Minecraft 1.7.10 most recently, and we were also affeced by the RedPower World mod from Minecraft 1.4.7. We remastered the biomes to fit with the modern minecraft style.
